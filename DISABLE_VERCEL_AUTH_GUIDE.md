   - **Email**: Enter your email and password

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Project
1. After logging in, you'll see your **Dashboard**
2. Look for a project card/tile labeled **"murdermysterynetlify"** or similar
   - The card will show:
     - Project name

## Method 2: Through Environment Variables (Alternative)

If you can't find protection settings, the authentication might be controlled by environment variables:

### Step 1: Navigate to Environment Variables
1. In your project dashboard, go to **"Settings"**
2. In the left sidebar, click **"Environment Variables"**

### Step 2: Look for Auth-Related Variables
Check for variables like:
- `PROTECTION_ENABLED`
- `AUTH_ENABLED`
- `VERCEL_PROTECTION`
- `PASSWORD_PROTECT`
- `BASIC_AUTH`

### Step 3: Disable Auth Variables
1. If you find any of these variables set to `true` or `enabled`:
   - Click the **three dots (‚ãÆ)** next to the variable
   - Select **"Edit"**
   - Change the value to **`false`** or **`disabled`**
   - Click **"Save"**
2. Alternatively, you can delete these variables:
   - Click the **three dots (‚ãÆ)**
   - Select **"Delete"**
   - Confirm deletion

### Step 4: Redeploy
1. After changing environment variables, you need to redeploy
2. Go to the **"Deployments"** tab
3. Find the most recent deployment
4. Click the **three dots (‚ãÆ)** menu
5. Select **"Redeploy"**

## Method 3: Through vercel.json Configuration

If protection is configured in code:

### Step 1: Check vercel.json
1. In your project dashboard, click **"View Git Repository"**
2. Look for a file called **`vercel.json`** in the root directory
3. Check for configuration like:
```json
{
  "protection": {
    "enabled": true
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Disable in Code
1. Edit the `vercel.json` file
2. Change `"enabled": true` to `"enabled": false`
3. Or remove the entire `"protection"` section
4. Commit and push the changes
5. Vercel will automatically redeploy

## Method 4: Using Vercel CLI (Command Line)

If you prefer command line:

### Prerequisites
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
2. Login: `vercel login`

### Disable Protection
```bash
vercel --prod
vercel env pull
# Edit .env file to disable protection
vercel env push
vercel --prod --force
```

---

## Verification Steps

### 1. Immediate Check
1. Open a **new incognito/private browser window**
2. Navigate to: **https://murdermysterynetlify.vercel.app**
3. The page should load **without** asking for:
   - Password
   - Login credentials
   - Any authentication

### 2. Clear Cache Check
1. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete on Windows, Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
2. Visit the URL again
3. Confirm no authentication is required

### 3. Mobile Check
1. Open the URL on your mobile phone
2. Use mobile data (not WiFi) to ensure a fresh connection
3. Verify the site loads without authentication

### 4. Share Test
1. Send the URL to a friend or colleague
2. Ask them to confirm they can access it without login

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't Find Protection Settings
**Solution**: Protection might be at the team level
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard home
2. Click on your **team name** (top-left)
3. Go to **"Team Settings"**
4. Look for **"Security"** or **"Protection"**

### Issue: Changes Don't Take Effect
**Solution**: Force a new deployment
1. Make a small change to any file (add a space, then save)
2. Commit and push to trigger redeployment
3. Or use **"Redeploy"** button in Vercel dashboard

### Issue: Still Showing Authentication
**Solution**: Check for multiple protection layers
1. Ensure no `.htaccess` or `.htpasswd` files in your project
2. Check for authentication middleware in your code
3. Verify no Cloudflare or other CDN protection

### Issue: "Permission Denied" When Changing Settings
**Solution**: Check your role
1. You need **"Admin"** or **"Owner"** role
2. Ask the project owner to change settings
3. Or request elevated permissions
